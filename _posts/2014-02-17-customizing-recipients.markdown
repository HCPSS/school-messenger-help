title: "Customizing your Recipient List"
---

Sending messages to your school community doesn't always involve sending to everyone that signed up. Sometimes, you'll want to target a specific grade-level, bus number, or a custom list of students. 

You can also build lists outside of messages, or create the a right before sending out a message.

## Creating a list before sending out a message

### Custom Rules

After you've clicked on the "new broadcast" button, you'll be directed to the first message screen. Enter in a subject and go under the "add message recipients" menu.

Underneath this menu you'll have a few options, the first of which allows you to access any lists you've already created and saved. This first option also has a defaulted list for all of your school and community members.

Custom rules allows you to add students who are listed under either a grade-level or bus number.

- Choose "bus to school" or "bus from school" depending on the time of day to select an individual bus number. Keep the criteria set to "is in". This will find students who are listed under a specific bus number. 

- Choose "grade level" to find students in a specific grade.

Once your selection is complete under either option, click on "save" and then "add recipients".

### Quick Pick

You can also do a quick pick right from your message if you're looking to quickly send to a group of students. All you need to know are their names, student IDs, or emails associated with their accounts. SchoolMessenger will do all the searching for you.

Search and then select the students you want to add. You can check off multiple students and then search again. After you've added the students, click on "add selected recipients".

This will add the list to your message, and from here you can either delete, save, or preview it.

- The x button will delete the list from your message.

- The cloud button will prompt you to give your list a title, and will save it to your lists after you send out your message. You can access that list in another message under "saved recipient lists".

- The eyeball allows you to preview the recipient list.

Click on continue to move on and send your message to that list. Remember, lists you choose to save will only be saved after the message has been sent. 

You can update and manage these lists at any time under "Lists" in the "Broadcasts" tab.  

## Building *grade lists* outside of a message

A common use-case for schools is sending to grades-only.

If you wanted to create a list without having to send out a message, go under the "Broadcasts" tab and then select "Lists".

![accessing lists](/school-messenger-help/images/broadcasts-lists.png)

Click on the add new list button to build a list from scratch. 

![add new list](/school-messenger-help/images/add-new-lists.png)

Give the list a name, such as "Grade 5", and the description is purely optional.

Under list content, select the field dropdown, then "grade level", and make sure "is" has been selected.

Check off a grade you'd like to send to, and then click on the add button.

A total amount of recipients will be generated to show you how many student records the message will go to.

Once your list is all set, click on done and the list can now be accessed under "saved message recipients" when you're crafting a new broadcast.

## Building custom *student lists* outside of a message

Another use-case is having a message list on hand of specific students. This can either be a sports team, students on a field trip, or any other contextual list that you might find yourself sending a message to. 

Same as before, go under the "Broadcasts" tab and then select "Lists" to add a new list. 

Go under the additional list tools menu and select "quick pick".

![quick pick](/school-messenger-help/images/quick-pick.png)

From here, you can search by the first and last name of students in your school to add specific students. You can also search by student ID, or the email addresses associated with a student account.

![quick pick list](/school-messenger-help/images/quick-pick-list.png)

As you search, simply check off the students. You can check off multiple students and conduct another search. Students are not added until you click done. 

Once you've gone in and checked everyone off, click done, and you should be brought back to the list overview page. This is where you'll have a preview of all students in the list.

After the list is all set, click on done and the list can now be accessed under "saved message recipients" when you're crafting a new broadcast.

![access saved list](/school-messenger-help/images/access-saved-list.png)

You can always delete a saved list by clicking on "delete" to the right of the list name.
