title: "Customizing Recipient Lists"
---

Sending messages to your school community doesn't always involve sending to everyone that signed up. Sometimes, you'll want to target a specific grade-level, bus number, or a custom list of students. 

You can build lists outside of messages, or create the list right before sending out a message. 

When building lists using custom rules or quick pick, the student data feeds from Aspen and is always fresh. Changes in the data will also get reflected in the lists from year to year.

There's also a way to build recipient lists using CSV files [if you're familiar with them.](/school-messenger-help/2014/02/17/exporting-emails.html)

## Creating a list before sending out a message

### Custom Rules

After you've clicked on the "new broadcast" button, you'll be directed to the first message screen. Enter in a subject and go under the "add message recipients" menu.

Underneath this menu you'll have a few options, the first of which allows you to access any lists you've already created and saved. The "saved recipient lists" option also has a defaulted list for all of your school and community members.

Custom rules allows you to add students who are listed under either a grade-level or bus number. These are the only two options you should worry about using.

- Choose "bus to school" or "bus from school" depending on the time of day to select an individual bus number. Keep the criteria set to "is in". This will load students who are listed under a specific bus number. 

- Choose "grade level" to load students in a specific grade.

Once your selection is complete under either option, click on "save" and then "add recipients".

### Quick Pick

You can also do a quick pick right from your message if you're looking to quickly send to a group of students. All you need to know are their names, student IDs, or emails associated with their accounts. SchoolMessenger will do all the searching for you.

Search and then select the students you want to add. You can check off multiple students and then search again. After you've added the students, click on "add selected recipients".

This will add the list to your message, and from here you can either delete, save, or preview it.

- The x button will delete the list from your message.

- The cloud button will prompt you to give your list a title, and will save it to your lists after you send out your message. You can access that list in another message under "saved recipient lists".

- The eyeball allows you to preview the recipient list.

Click on continue to move on and send your message to that list. 

> Lists you choose to save in a new broadcast will only be saved after the message has been sent. 

You can update and manage these lists at any time under "Lists" in the "Broadcasts" tab.  

## Building custom student lists outside of a message

Another use-case is having a message list on hand that has specific students. This can either be a sports team, students on a field trip, or any other contextual list that you might find yourself sending a message to. 

Under the "Broadcasts" tab, select "Lists" and then add a new list.

![add new list](/school-messenger-help/images/add-new-lists.png)

Keep the targetted recipients set to the default for "both".

![target](/school-messenger-help/images/csv/target-recipients.png)

Go under the additional list tools menu and select "quick pick".

![quick pick](/school-messenger-help/images/quick-pick.png)

From here, you can search by the first and last name of students in your school to add specific students. You can also search by student ID, or the email addresses associated with a student's account.

![quick pick list](/school-messenger-help/images/quick-pick-list.png)

As you search, simply check off the students. You can check off multiple students and conduct another search. Students are not added until you click done. 

Once you've gone in and checked everyone off, click done, and you should be brought back to the list overview page. This is where you'll have a preview of all students in the list.

![preview button](/school-messenger-help/images/csv/preview-csv.png)

After the list is all set click on done.

![done editing](/school-messenger-help/images/csv/save-uploaded-manual-list.png)

The list can now be accessed under "saved message recipients" when you're crafting a new broadcast. This list will remain on your account as long as you'd like. 

![access saved list](/school-messenger-help/images/access-saved-list.png)

Under your "list" tab, you can always delete a saved list by clicking on "delete" to the right of the list name.
