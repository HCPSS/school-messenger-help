title: "Using the Important Message Stationary"
---

There are a variety of different devices and mediums that parents receive messages on. Web Services has designed a template that follows a standard emergency message format. 

This stationary is meant for messages that are **emergencies only.** This includes school-based cancellations or emergencies that pertain only to your building.

## Brevity Matters

> This isn't an all-inclusive approach because every emergency situation calls for different approaches. However, this message format is typically what parents are looking for.

During an emergency situation it's imperative for your communication to be as brief and easy to understand as possible. 

The ideal message states the reason for the emergency message (e.g. gas leak, water pipe break, power outage, non-drill lockdown) coupled with an action step such as an early dismissal, cancellations, or evacuation. Ensure parents that students are safe and taken care of.

After stating the emergency, go over the protocol that your school is following to further ensure the safety of students or how the emergency situation is being handled. 

When concluding, provide contact information for questions or concerns.

The ideal message would look like this:

<section style="background-color: #e7e7e7; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 10px;">
<p>Around 9am, the power went out at our school. Students are safe and have been attending regular classes. Due to cold temperatures and an unknown timeline for a fix from BGE, we are dismissing early today.</p>

<p>Dismissal will begin at 10am for all students and all after-school activities, including child care, have been cancelled. Students may be picked up by the contacts listed on their Emergency Procedure card.</p>

<p>Phones are operational, so please contact our front office at 555-555-5555 if you have any concerns.</p>
</section>

## Inserting the Stationary

After adding a subject, specifying the message as an emergency, and adding recipients, the second screen will have email and SMS buttons.

Select the email button first. You can craft the SMS message afterwards to either match or be an abbreviated form of your message afterwards.

That will open up an additional box for selecting stationary. The important message stationary is meant for emergencies only, so it should be used in any scenario when you're also using the text message feature. 

> Important messages are **not** reminders for school events, please use the simple message stationary for these non-emergency messages

Your important message template should be titled with your school acronym, followed by " - Important Message".

Select "Use Selected Stationary" after clicking on the important message template.

## Editing inside of the stationary

Emergency Messages should be simple in their formatting. Avoid any styling except for bolding text. 

Don't worry about attaching any files or images.

The dotted box is where you can add your message text and is the only place where text can be edited. The top and bottom text areas cannot be edited. If any information needs to be changed in either of these areas, please let [Web Services](mailto:webmaster@hcpss.org) know.

In the message area, feel free to either type up your message or paste content in.

## Pasting from word

If you're choosing to type up your message in Microsoft Word, it's important to **always** run any text coming in from Microsoft Word through the word clipboard. 

Copy all your text from Microsoft Word.

![copy microsoft word](/school-messenger-help/images/copy-ms-word.png)

Inside of SchoolMessenger, highlight the text that's already in there, and then select the "paste from word" clipboard icon on your toolbar.

After pasting it in there may be some extra space, but most of the time this will go through as a single return between paragraphs.

Select "done" once your message is all set, and from there you can send it to your recipients.
