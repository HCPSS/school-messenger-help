Immediately after sending out a broadcast a message report will be generated. On the dashboard underneath "broadcasts" there are reports on the most recently sent messages.

To access the report's contents hover over the wrench and screwdriver. Then, click on "report".

This should bring up a broadcast summary page. There's a "related links" section with links to a copy of the PDF report that was sent to you, a time distribution breakdown, and the "recipients not contacted" list.

## Recipients Not Contacted

The "recipients not contacted" link will show you parents who have been blocked, didn't provide an email, or were a duplicate email contact. 

Duplicates are parents who have more than one child at your school and are sent the message once instead of twice.

Blocked parents often times have a full inbox, spam filter turned on, or were unsubscribed. If a parent is ever blocked and wants to get messages again, forward them over to Web Services at 410-313-1257 or <a href="mailto:webmaster@hcpss.org">webmaster@hcpss.org</a>. 

To search for a parent on the block list you can use your browser's "find" feature. On a Mac use <code>command+F</code> and on a PC use <code>control+F</code>. Then, search for the last name or email of the parent in question. If needed, you will have to cycle over to the next page to search through the entire list.

## Other Metrics

The report feature will also give you a summary on the total number of recipients that were contacted along with the total number of emails sent. 

This metric is shown underneath the summary area. Remember that the recipient number will usually be lower than the number of emails sent. This is because recipient data is based off the amount of students at your school.

Beneath the summary under totals there are also numbers on the amount of duplicates removed as well as the parents who did not have an email address listed. 

## Checking all emails

Underneath totals, you can click on "email:" to view all recipients who were contacted. This is useful to check whether or not that a parent has been able to read or skim a message. Similar to searching the blocked list, you can search this contact list using your browsers find feature and then cycle through lists with the page selection feature.
