Immediately after sending out a broadcast a message report will be generated. On the dashboard underneath "broadcasts" there are reports for the most recently sent messages.

Hover over the wrench and screwdriver, then click on "report".

It should bring up a broadcast summary page. There's a "related links" section with links to a copy of the PDF report that was sent to you, time distribution, and recipients not contacted list.

## Recipients Not Contacted

The "recipients not contacted" link will show you parents who had been blocked, didn't provide an email, or were a duplicate email. 

Blocked parents can either have a full inbox, spam filter turned on, or unsubscribed. If a parent is ever blocked and wants to get messages again, forward them over to Web Services at 410-313-1257 or <a href="mailto:webmaster@hcpss.org">webmaster@hcpss.org</a>.

Duplicates are parents who have more than one child at your school and are sent the message once instead of twice. 

To search for a parent on this list, use your browser's "find" feature. On a Mac, this is <code>command+F,</code> and on a PC it's <code>control+F</code>. Then, search for the last name or email of the parent. If needed, you will have to cycle over to the next page to search the entire list.

## Other Metrics

The report feature will also give you a summary on the total number of recipients that were contacted, and the number of emails. 

This is shown underneath the summary area. Remember that the recipient number will usually be lower than the number of emails because that data is based off the amount of students at your school.

Beneath the summary under totals, there's also numbers on the amount of duplicates removed and parents who didn't have an email listed. 

## Checking all emails

Underneath totals, you can click on "email:" to view all recipients who were contacted. This is useful to check if a parent has been able to read or skim a message. You can search using your browsers find feature and cycle through lists by using the page feature.
