title: "Understanding Reports"

Immediately after sending out a broadcast a message report will be generated. On the dashboard underneath "broadcasts" there are reports on the most recently sent messages.

To access the report's contents, hover over the wrench and screwdriver. Then, click on "report".

This should bring up a broadcast summary page. There's a "related links" section with links to a copy of the PDF report that was sent to you, a time distribution breakdown, and the "recipients not contacted" list.

## Recipients Not Contacted

The "recipients not contacted" link will show you parents who have been blocked, didn't provide an email, or were a duplicate email contact. 

Duplicates are parents who have more than one child at your school and get the message sent to them once instead of twice.

Blocked parents often times have a full inbox, spam filter turned on, or were unsubscribed. If a parent is ever blocked and wants to receive messages again, forward them over to Web Services at 410-313-1257 or <a href="mailto:webmaster@hcpss.org">webmaster@hcpss.org</a>. 

To search for a parent on the block list you can use your browser's "find" feature. On a Mac use <code>command+F</code> and on a PC use <code>control+F</code>. Then, search for the last name or email of the parent in question. If needed, you will have to cycle over to the next page to search through the entire list.

## Other Metrics

The report feature will also give you a total number of recipients that were contacted along with the total number of emails sent. 

This metric is shown underneath the summary area. Remember that the recipient number will usually be lower than the number of emails sent. This is because recipient data is based off the amount of students, not parents, at your school.

Beneath the summary there are also the amount of duplicates removed as well as parents who did not have an email address listed. 

## Looking at all emails

Underneath totals, you can click on "email:" to view all recipients who were contacted. This is useful to check whether or not a parent has read or skimmed a message. Similar to searching the blocked list, you can search this entire contact list using your browsers' find feature and then cycle through individual lists with the page selection feature.
