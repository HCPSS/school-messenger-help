## Getting Started

After logging into the system, the first screen is called the Dashboard. On the right side there is a large button labeled "New Broadcast". Click this button to get started.

![new broadcast](/school-messenger-help/images/new-broadcast.png)

Screen 1 contains the subject and message type areas. The subject area will be the name of your Broadcast. Once you've added a subject the icon next to the text field will turn green.

In the dropdown, "General" messages are for reminders or newsletters and "School Hours Emergency" or "Non-School Hours Emergency" are for emergencies only.

## Recipients

Select the “Saved Recipients Lists…” from the "Add Message Recipients" dropdown menu to access a saved list that contains all families and community members for your school location.

![saved list](/school-messenger-help/images/access-saved-list.png)

Select the “_SchoolName (All Students + Community)” list and click “Add Recipients”. 

![saved list](/school-messenger-help/images/school-message-list-recipients.png)

This recipient count will fluctuate as new students are enrolled at your school.

You can also add yourself as a recipient to get a copy of the message. This is also a good way to test messages without sending it to the entire school community.

![saved list](/school-messenger-help/images/add-me.png)

Click on continue to get to the next screen once you've added your recipients.

## Message Content

For a general message you will always be sending an email. For an emergency message, you can send both an email and a text message. Remeber, late busses are considered emergency messages.

> **Note:** The SMS option is for emergency messages only, never send out a general reminder through SMS

Click on the email button to get started on a new email message.

Select the simple message stationary. Then, click on "use selected stationary".

<a href="/school-messenger-help/2014/02/17/important-message-stationary.html">There are specific instructions</a> for using the Important Message stationary, which is used only for emergencies.

![saved list](/school-messenger-help/images/simple-message-stationary.png)

Once the stationary has loaded up, the "from email" field should be defaulted to your school. 

However, the email area has to be changed to "no-reply@hcpss.org". This blocks users from replying to your defaulted email address directly and helps the message look less like spam. 

![saved list](/school-messenger-help/images/subject-from-name.png)

> **Note:** no-reply@hcpss.org is the best email to set the message to. Avoid adding in any other characters or numbers

You can also attach files. SchoolMessenger allows up to three files, but each file must be under 2MB in size. 

![saved list](/school-messenger-help/images/attach-files.png)

Web Services would be happy to downside any large PDFs for you. Please email us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@hcpss.org">webmaster@hcpss.org</a> if you need a PDF brought down below 2MB.

<a id="message-editing"></a>

The defaulted message area has a title, important text, and a body area that you can change. 

You can delete the important text area. However, you can add your school's motto or the day's date if it's an area you'd rather not leave blank.

![saved list](/school-messenger-help/images/default-message-area.png)

Avoid changing the footer area.

## Using the Toolbar

The only styling options you have to worry about using in the toolbar are bold and italicize. The font should be kept to the default, along with the font-size. This promotes read-ability across all devices. 

### Pasting from word

If you're choosing to type up your message in Microsoft Word, it's important to **always** run any text coming in from Microsoft Word through the word clipboard. 

First, copy all your text from Microsoft Word.

![copy microsoft word](/school-messenger-help/images/copy-ms-word.png)

Inside of SchoolMessenger, highlight the text that's already in there, and then select the "paste from word" clipboard icon on your toolbar.

![paste from microsoft word](/school-messenger-help/images/highlight-paste-from-word-2.png)

After pasting your content into the editor there may be some extra space, but most of the time these will go through as a single return between paragraphs.

### Adding Links

Any link you add to a message has to be copied from a URL bar. Links should never be copied over from Outlook because there is a behind-the-scenes redirect associated with these links.

Open any emailed links in a new window and copy the "clean" URL from the the URL bar.

![URL bar](/school-messenger-help/images/URL-bar.png)

Highlight the text you want to make a link and then click on the link button.

![highlight text](/school-messenger-help/images/highlight-text.png)

![add a link](/school-messenger-help/images/add-link.png)

From here, you can paste in the URL that was just copied. Don't worry about changing the protocol.

![link area](/school-messenger-help/images/link-area.png)

To ensure that links are opening in a new window, go under target and set the dropdown to "new window (_blank)". This is a good way to ensure that users are not taken away from your news message after they follow a link.

![new window](/school-messenger-help/images/new-window.png)

If everything is lined up correctly, then the text that was highlighted should now become a hyperlink leading to the linked URL.

You can always preview your message links by clicking on the preview button.

![preview message](/school-messenger-help/images/preview.png)

At any point, you can also erase the email content by clicking on the discard button if you'd like to start from scratch.

Click on the "save email message" to move on to the final screen after your content is all set.

## Sending

Once you're on the final screen, you can always move back a step within the green timeline.

![move back](/school-messenger-help/images/moving-around.png)

Just note that you can never move forward using the timeline.

Once you're at the final screen it's always a good idea to check your recipient count. This was a test message so there's only one recipient. 

![recipient count](/school-messenger-help/images/checking-messages.png)

When you're sending to your whole school community the recipient count will be in the mid to upper hundreds, or even the thousands at the middle and high school levels.

The message content area will have a green checkmark next to the message type you're sending out. In the case of general messages, the email area will be checked off. During emergencies, both the email and SMS area will be checked off.

![message content](/school-messenger-help/images/message-content.png)

The message options area can stay set to the defaulted boxes that are checked off for you. Your staff email address will be sent a PDF copy of the message report once it's sent.

![message options](/school-messenger-help/images/options.png)

If you ever want to re-use a message later on, check off the "save message content" option. You'll be prompted to give it a descriptive title, and it can be accessed later on. View our documentation <a href="/school-messenger-help/2014/02/17/creating-draft-message.html#saved-messages">on accessing saved messages.</a>

Select the "send now" button to send out the message. There's also a scheduling feature if you'd like a message to go out on a particular date and time.

![send now](/school-messenger-help/images/send.png)

The system will begin sending your message to the recipients on your list. You can monitor the progress from the Dashboard after clicking "Send Now". You'll see your job running in the "In Progress" section. 

You can click on the Dashboard button to see the most up-to-date status of your message. It will move to "Completed" once it's sent.
