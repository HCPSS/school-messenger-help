title: "Pre-Registered Kindergarten Parents"
---

Parents of new Kindergarten students are rolled over automatically into Aspen in late-July. They will be enabled for recieving messages around this time.

Until then, your school might want to get in contact with pre-registered parents for information regarding the first day of school, transitioning their children, or events they might be interested in.

## In Aspen

### Finding the Emails

- Navigate to the student tab
- Use the filter menu to select "PreReg Kindergarten for Next Year"
- Select the Field Set icon
- Select "Emergency Contact Field Set"

### Export to Excel

- Select the Quick Print icon
- Use "Web Page (HTML)"
- When the report displays, select Edit > Select All, Edit > Copy

### Inside of Excel
- Paste it all into Excel
- Delete everything except for the first name, last name, and email address column. Make sure they are in that order.
- Go to file > save as > and change the format to Windows Comma Separated (.csv)

> A CSV, or comma separated value, is a file type used for databases to easily load up large data sets.

## Sending with SchoolMessenger

These parents will not be loaded into SchoolMessenger with their student's information until late-july. Therefore, inside of SchoolMessenger you'll need to upload that CSV to get their information in there temporarily. 

Start up a new broadcast. Under "add message recipients" go to "upload list".

Add the csv file we created under "choose file", then click next.

If your csv has three columns (first, last, and one email), it should show you a first name, last name, and a third colum defaulted to phone 1.

Change that third column to email 1, this will enable them to get the email message. After that, select the green "add message recipients" button to finish.

> There can only be one email address associated to one parent

You can always preview the recipients by clicking on the eyeball icon. This is a good place to check and see if the names are lined up with an email address.

Clicking on the "0 phones, 1 email, 0 sms" area lets you see what's in their contact field. This is a good way to always make sure that email 1 is filled out.

![checking email and sms](/school-messenger-help/images/checking-email-sms.png)

Before sending to this group of contacts, it's a good idea to save the list with the cloud icon. 

Select the cloud icon next to the automatically generated list name.

![save list](/school-messenger-help/images/save-email-list.png)

Give it a descriptive with a date, for instance "Pre-reg Kindergaten Parents - 1/17/15" or something to that effect. This is to avoid confusion if you decided to upload another CSV later on.

From here, just send a message as usual. The list is now saved for you to re-use on future messages.

You can always access this list from the "add message recipients" dropdown under "saved recipient lists".

## Refreshing the data

A downside for using this option is keeping the data fresh by pulling down the CSV a few times before the late-July turnover. This keeps the list populated with the most up-to-date parents for your messages.

> When you upload a new list it completely overwrites the former list entires. Luckily, the most recent CSV should have the previously entered names along with any recently registered parents.

Under Broadcasts, there is a menu titled, "lists". 

![find list](/school-messenger-help/images/select-lists.png)

Under lists you should find the list you uploaded as a CSV file. 

![view list](/school-messenger-help/images/viewing-uploaded-list.png)

Select "edit" to the far right.

![edit list](/school-messenger-help/images/uploaded-list-options.png)

Then, under the additional list tools menu use the "upload list" option.

![upload the list again](/school-messenger-help/images/refresh-upload-list.png)

From there you'll upload a list similar to before. However, after uploading and clicking next, make sure the columns show "first name", "last name", and "email 1". Then, save the list.

![save the uploaded list](/school-messenger-help/images/save-uploaded-list.png)

To fully finish, click on done once you're back at the list overview.

## Removing parents

Moving over these parent emails involves a large data dumping and there may be some folks who might not want to recieve information from their child's upcoming school.

You can always remove parents from the list by previewing the list.

![save the uploaded list](/school-messenger-help/images/preview-email-list.png)

Then, uncheck the parents you no longer want in the list. 

![uncheck the parents](/school-messenger-help/images/uncheck-parents.png)

Click on done after unchecking the ones you want removed, and they should be off the list.
