title: "Pre-Registered Kindergarten Parents"

## Overview

Parents of new Kindergarten students are rolled over automatically into Aspen in late-July. They will be enabled for recieving messages around this time.

Until then, your school might want to get in contact with pre-registered parents for information regarding the first day of school, transitioning their children, or events they might be interested in.

These steps can be completed in ...

### Finding the students

- Navigate to the student tab
- Use the filter menu to select "PreReg Kindergarten for Next Year"

### See parent emails

- Select the Field Set icon
- Select "Emergency Contact Field Set"

### Export the information to use in Excel

- Select the Quick Print icon
- Use "Web Page (HTML)"
- When the report displays, select Edit > Select All, Edit > Copy
- Open Excel, then paste it in
- Delete everything except for the first name, last name, and email address column. Make sure they are in that order.
- Go to file > save as > and change the format to Windows Comma Separated (.csv)

Note: A CSV, or comma separated value, file is used for databases to easily load up large data sets.

### Sending with SchoolMessenger

These parents will not be loaded into SchoolMessenger with their student's information until late-july. Therefore, inside of SchoolMessenger you'll need to upload that CSV we created to get their information in there temporarily. 

- Under "add message recipients" go to "upload list"
- Add the csv file we created under "choose file", then click next
- If your csv has three columns (first, last, and one email), it should show you a first name, last name, and a third colum defaulted to phone 1
- Change that third column to email 1, this will enable them to get the email message

Note: There can only be one email address associated to one parent

- Select the green "add message recipients" button to finish

You can always preview the recipients by clicking on the eyeball icon. This is a good place to check and see if the names are lined up with an email address. Clicking on the "0 phones, 1 email, 0 sms" text lets you see what's in their contact area, always make sure email 1 is filled out.

Before sending to this group of contacts, it's a good idea to save the list with the cloud icon. 

- Select the cloud icon next to the generic list name
- Title it something with a date, for instance "Pre-reg Kindergaten Parents - 1/17/15"
- This is to avoid confusion if you decided to upload another CSV later on

From here, just send a message as usual. 

### Refreshing the data

A downside for using this option is you'll have to pull down the CSV once a month or so until the late-July turnover. 

This keeps the list populated with the most up-to-date parents for your messages.

Under Broadcasts, there is a menu titled, "lists". Under lists you should find the list you uploaded as a CSV file. Select edit to the far right, then under the additional list tools menu use the "upload list" option. 

From there you'll upload a list similar to before. However, after uploading and clicking next, specify the columns to show "first name", "last name", and "email 1". Then save the list.

Note: When you upload a new list it completely overwrites the former list entires. Luckily, the CSV should have the previously entered names along with any new names added recently.
